<h1>Wolf's Stopwatch</h1>


A simple mod that adds an on-screen stopwatch into Minecraft!

To start or stop the stopwatch, use the [Start/Stop] keybind, which can be configured in the controls menu. By default, this will be set to [R].

To reset the stopwatch, use the [Reset] keybind, which can be configured in the controls menu. By default, this will be set to [G].

Pressing [Reset] with no time on the stopwatch will toggle the overlay, disabling it. If it is already disabled, the [Reset] key will enable it once more.

Notes: 
- The stopwatch position is currently hard-coded, but will be configurable in a later update.
- Activating the stopwatch while the overlay is disabled will cause it to start immediately as soon as the overlay is reenabled.
- The stopwatch is only present in-world, and is not accessible or usable through menus.
- The stopwatch will not pause when the game is paused.
- Stopwatch values are not saved on leaving a world.

Possible uses for the stopwatch include:
- Speedrunning.
- Hide and seek.
- Farm efficiency tracking.
- And more!
